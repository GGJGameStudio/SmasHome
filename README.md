# SmasHome

Game developped during the Global Game Jam 2019 !

The theme was : What home means to us? 

For us, it means : Brotherhood war! SmasHome is a game inspired by our best fights between brothers and sisters. The game begins during babyhood, where you can throw your plush to your siblings from your cradle, to the seniorhood where you can finish them with your zimmer-frame, passing by teenage and adulthood. Each period offers its own gameplay, but the goal remains the same: to tussle with your siblings all over the house, with whatever you want!

To run the game, download Unity 2018.3.3f1, open the projet and enjoy!
